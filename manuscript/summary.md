Frameworks are deceptive. They seem easy. They look like a pretty
isolated special topic. And now we’ve seen how common and com‐
plicated they are, like a not-entirely-small meteoroid that passes
every single planetary object in our web development solar system.
Frameworks are not trivial. If I may distract from the speed with
which I typed this down, with brevity as an excuse goal, then any
question still open is due to that very fact that they’re not.

But I want to recap. Professional web development is about quality.
Quality is not easy to define, but one part of it is tailored code.
External frameworks without customization options are impossible
for users to tailor, and a pain for developers. Internal frameworks
are much easier to handle and generally the way to go. Good frame‐
works aim for the highest quality—to be tailored, usable, and exten‐
sible. Framework users should follow the documentation and not
overwrite framework code. Framework developers should have
principles, a prototype, quality management tools, a maintenance
plan, and healthy interest in documentation. And still, things can go
wrong.

If they don’t, we may be on to the one framework. The one frame‐
work for us. Well done.
